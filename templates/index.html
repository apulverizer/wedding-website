                                <p>I was born and raised in Central New York. I began my college education at RIT where I met Aaron, and finished my Bachelor's degree at SUNY Brockport. I'm eagerly awaiting our new adventures in Maine. I enjoy the outdoors, not wearing pants, obsessing over our rescue dogs, listening to sad white girl music, yelling at video games, and general cheeky shenanigans.

                                <p>I was born and raised in Naples, NY. I received my Bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from RIT in 2014, and then I took a casual five-month long walk from Maine to Georgia. I currently work at ESRI in downtown Portland, ME as a software engineer. In my free time I enjoy hiking, biking, working on projects, and watching the Bills lose.

                        <p>Four years ago, I was just a girl who had a crush on a guy who had a girlfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do, which was just to...wait. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a friend but I think, even then, I knew I was waiting for my husband. Okay, I totally ripped that off of The Office, but it does a really nice job of summarizing our story.
                        <p>Aaron and I met at the beginning of our Freshman year at RIT. We talked a bit that year, but it wasn’t love at first sight. When I moved to Florida, we stayed in touch by playing xbox together. I found myself staying up late every night just to talk to Aaron about our days. The more I learned about him, the deeper my feelings grew. We remained "just best friends" for a long time. But when I moved back to New York, I took a chance and expressed my feelings to him. Turns out he felt the same way all along. Who knew?

                        <h4 class="h-speaker">Aaron</h4>
                        <p>I guess I’ll pick up where Dawn left off. We began our official relationship in August of 2013, but I felt like we already had years of foundation beneath us. Since then we've enjoyed sharing the adventures of life together. I knew pretty early on that Dawn was the "one", but it wasn’t until after I had a better idea of the ring that I put the gears in motion.
                        <p>We made plans to do a hike in the Adirondacks on the morning of New Year’s Eve. We ended up choosing Bald Mountain, and even though we've both hiked it many times, seeing it so quiet, covered with fresh snow was uniquely beautiful. When the other hikers cleared out, I expressed to Dawn how much she meant to me, before I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. She said yes, which made the hike down a lot easier than the nerve-wracking hike up!

He likes playing video games, creating music, and making cool shit.

Scott currently lives in Houston where he works as a mechanical engineer.

The festivities are being held on the Loj lawn so we recommend wearing shoes you can comfortably navigate the terrain in. As far as what to wear, anything you feel fits the 'dressy-casual' category will likely be fine, but feel free to direct any questions or concerns our way.

                       Unfortunately our dream venue has us capped at a guest-list of 55 people, including us. While we always wanted a smaller and more intimate wedding, we had no idea how difficult it would be to remain within that limit. Due to that constraint we ask that you take note of your rsvp card and the outter envelope for additional guest information. If you would like to bring a date, but have not been given an additional seat, please contact us to see what we can do. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns our way as well.

There will be snacks and platters available to munch on and a few lawn games, like corn hole and kan jam, to play. You're also welcome to walk around the property and take in the beautiful heart lake during it's peak foliage week. We just ask that everyone keep in mind that other people will still be using the property, and that the Loj is only to be entered for use of their restrooms.
