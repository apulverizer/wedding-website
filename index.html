                                <p>I was born and raised in Naples, NY – a small town tucked away in the middle of the beautiful finger lakes. I received my Bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from RIT in 2014, and then I took a five-month long casual walk from Maine to Georgia. After I finished with the Appalachian Trail, Dawn and I moved to Salt Lake City, so I could obtain my Master’s degree in Geography from the University of Utah. In my free time I enjoy hiking, biking, watching the Bills lose, being a nerd, and pwning n00bs.

                                <p>I’m from a small town outside of Utica, NY (You’ll remember that name when you taste the food at the wedding). I attended college at RIT where I met Aaron, and finished my undergraduate education at SUNY Brockport. I currently reside in Salt Lake City, Utah but I’m eagerly awaiting our move to Maine. I’m obsessed with our rescue dog, Dacks. I enjoy the outdoors, not wearing pants, listening to sad white girl music, yelling at video games, spending time with my homies, and general cheeky shenanigans.

He has a thoughtful and charismatic personality making him a great fit for my best man. Jason is currently studying Business at Robert’s Wesleyan College. He enjoys hunting, fishing, sports, and “trying” to beat me at things.

He is currently finishing his Master’s degree in Microbiology at Brockport, where he also TA's classes. Ben enjoys hiking, biking, whiskey, playing video games, and making people laugh.

Kerk is wrapping up his final year at WPI where he studies Biomedical engineering. He enjoys traveling, hiking, playing games, and building cool things.                        </div>

In her free time, she enjoys traveling, spending time with her friends and family, and enjoying the outdoors.

Scott’s lighthearted humor and fun personality forced me to actually have fun in college – we spent a lot of time skiing, playing racquetball, and turning everything into a competition. Scott currently lives in Houston where he works as a mechanical engineer.

He likes playing video games, creating music, and making cool shit.

Since then we've gone on some cool adventures and I look forward to many more. Ryan is in the 8th grade, where he studies all the things. He enjoys hockey, video games, and dank memes. In addition to Ryan’s title as Groomsmen, he will also be the “Keeper of the dog” for Dacks, a role he’s pretty excited about.
