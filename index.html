                                <p>I’m from a small town outside of Utica, NY (You’ll remember that name when you taste the food at the wedding). I started college at RIT where I met Aaron, and finished my education at SUNY Brockport. I currently reside in Salt Lake City, Utah but I’m eagerly awaiting our move to Maine. I’m obsessed with our rescue dog, Dacks. I enjoy the outdoors, not wearing pants, listening to sad white girl music, yelling at video games, spending time with my homies, and general cheeky shenanigans.

                                <p>I was born and raised in Naples, NY – a small town tucked away in the middle of the beautiful finger lakes. I received my Bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from RIT in 2014, and then I took a five-month long casual walk from Maine to Georgia. After I finished with the Appalachian Trail, Dawn and I moved to Salt Lake City, so I could obtain my Master’s degree in Geography from the University of Utah. In my free time I enjoy hiking, biking, watching the Bills lose, being a nerd, and pwning n00bs.

                        <p>“Four years ago, I was just a girl who had a crush on a guy who had a girlfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do, which was just to...wait. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with friend but I think, even then I knew...I was waiting for my husband." Okay, I totally ripped that off of The Office, but it does a really nice job of summing our story up in better words than I could have pieced together. 
                        <p>Aaron and I met at the beginning of our Freshman year at RIT. We talked a bit that year, but I was mostly friends with his roommates so it definitely wasn’t a match made at the start. When I moved to Florida, my friends and I stayed in touch by playing xbox together. I found myself staying up later than everyone else just to talk to Aaron in chat, or text him before we fell asleep. The more I learned about him, the more my feelings for him grew. I was initially terrified that my feelings would be unrequited, so I held back. But when I moved back to New York, the heartache grew too overwhelming, so I FINALLY expressed my feelings to him. Turns out he felt the same way all along. Who knew?

                        <p>I guess I’ll pick up where Dawn left off. We began our official relationship in August of 2013, but I felt like we already had years of foundation beneath us. Since then I’ve enjoyed getting to share my adventures with her, and the feeling of being able to support one another in life’s joys and sorrows. I knew pretty early on that Dawn was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but it wasn’t until after I had a better idea of the ring that I put the gears in motion.
                        <p>We were in New York visiting family for Christmas and New Year’s, and had decided to drive up to the Adirondacks, our favorite place, to do a hike after fresh snowfall. On the morning of New Year’s Eve, we hiked to the top of Bald Mountain. We’ve both hiked that mountain so many times, but seeing it so quiet, with a fresh covering of fresh snow was uniquely beautiful. When the other hikers cleared out, I expressed to Dawn how much she meant to me, before I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. She said yes, which made the hike down a lot easier than the nervous hike up!

Scott currently lives in Houston where he works as a mechanical engineer.

                            <p>Ryan is actually Dawn’s younger cousin, who I first met in 2013 after years of playing xbox together. Since then we've gone on some cool adventures and I look forward to many more. Ryan is in the 8th grade, where he studies all the things. He enjoys hockey, video games, and dank memes. In addition to Ryan’s title as Groomsmen, he will also be the “Keeper of the dog” for Dacks, a role he’s pretty excited about.

                            <p>Dacks is our kelpie border-collie that we adopted in the summer of 2015. He is a cheese connoisseur who is passionate about tennis balls. In his free time he enjoys hiking, kayaking, sleeping in the middle of the bed, and cuddling up next to his best friend, Lambchop.

                    <p>For your convenience, we have blocked out (##) rooms at the (HOTEL NAME) Friday September 29th, and Saturday September 30th, though you don’t have to stay both nights. (HOTEL NAME) is located in downtown Lake Placid, offering a central location to most of the area’s activities, shops, and restaurants.  Please note that all rooms that are not reserved by (DATE) will be released. Please mention the Pulver wedding when booking, and use group code (CODE). 
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com">(HOTEL NAME)</a> is definitely not the only option for lodging in the area. There are many other hotel, motel and inn options located in the area. Families and friends can group up and rent a vacation house through VRBO, or Adirondack by Owner. There are also cabin rentals available through the Adirondack Mountain Club, and rooms available through AirBNB. (See links)
                    <p>The wedding weekend is situated at the peak of the fall foliage, so while we don’t anticipate any large events going on at the same time, it is still a busy tourist weekend for the area.
